- SQL (Databases, currently learning) 

## 📚 What I'm learning
- Object-oriented programming (Java)
- Data structures & algorithms (C++)

## 🚀 Projects 
This GitHub profile contains: 
- Practice exercises I create myself to strengthen my skills in Java, C++, and SQL.

  Examples:
  - [cppbasics](https://github.com/31v1/cppbasics) C++ exercises ranging from traditional basics to intermediate but with a bear story.
  - [cpp-intermediate](https://github.com/31v1/cpp-intermediate) Intermediate C++ exercises following the bear story.
    
- University projects that I upload to showcase my academic work and improve them over time. Code and documentation are written in Spanish, as the projects were developed in an academic context.
  
  Examples:
  - [Pet Report Manager – Console Version](https://github.com/31v1/Pet-Report-Manager) Java OOP project with inheritance, polymorphism, and file persistence.
  - [Pet Report Manager – GUI Version](https://github.com/31v1/Pet-Report-Manager-GUI-version) Java Swing application with forms, tables, and coincidence detection.
